# PHPVegas\web-scraper-examples

Some sample web scraper scripts using [Goutte](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/Goutte)

Please note the following:

* You need PHP 5.5+ and [composer](http://getcomposer.org) to install deps

* The basic examples are in the **examples/** directory

* Some code I did for a code challange interview is in the **dell-product-scraper/** and **src/** directory.
